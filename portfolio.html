            <p class = "h1info">This house example comes from a real completed job. It was a redesign of the kitchen area, with a full makeover including the countertops, cabinets, and an addition of background tiling for the walls around the sink and oven/stovetop area. Its construction and remodeling was completed by our talented team and their work is completely customizeable to fit the customer request and budget. This particular example includes cabinets that stretch across the wall past the main cooking area to provide more storage space. With a smooth wood top on the counter and a brick tiling on the counter islands, the kitchen comes together with a clean and aesthetic appeal.</p>

                <p class = "h2info">This particular job example displays a full makeover of the outdoors area of a house. Along with a full repainting of the outside walls of the house, it also came with a remodeling and redesigning of the outdoor area and pool. We are skilled in both interior and exterior design, allowing us to aid in things other than construction. The outdoor canopy was built with contracted curtains that can spread out in case of a desire for shade or to close the area when not in use. It took 7 days of all around construction and design to be complete. Lights were installed lining the supports to allow for a simple and convenient placement in the design.</p>
