            <p>Jose Ricardo Garduno is a handyman who initially started 20 years ago working on a construction site and doing small jobs around town. Growing up, Mr. Garduno had to fix everything around him. This led him into remodeling. He remodeled not only inside a house, but outside of one too. In 2017 Mr. Garduno realized he could turn his passion into a business, with the goals of making clients happy, and spending more time with his family. He is always open minded to new ideas made by customers, he's there for it all and is very responsive. Jose believes that customers are always first priority when it comes to work.Garduno always likes to do a good job and never leave a job unfinished, he is always happy to be there when something breaks and lend a helping hand. he materials mr.Garduno uses consist of good materials that leave the job done well. Most of his tiles consist of Marvey tiles, where the customer can choose from with a different price range. He uses grande grout to put cement and tile in which leaves a clean look as seen in the portfolio. Most of his material to fix fans comes from home depot and he lists with the customer before buying and that's when the cost is effective. The business promises to leave a clean look with good products to ensure a customer is always happy
